Hello

Collabrotive financial Calculator project.

# For those new to git
Download for GitHub desktop https://desktop.github.com/download/

You can also use VSCode or Git Bash terminals, but I prefer the app.

NetBeans technically works but commiting is more tedious.

NOTE: Once project is underway, commits directly to main won't be allowed and any pull requests will require review so make sure you understand how to make branches and create pull requests

# Project Outline
## Currency Coverter
Using webscraping. Self explanatory.
## Mortgage Calculator
"The Mortgage Calculator helps estimate the monthly payment due along with other financial costs associated with mortgages. There are options to include extra payments or annual percentage increases of common mortgage-related expenses. The calculator is mainly intended for use by U.S. residents."
## Amortization Calculator
"There are two general definitions of amortization. The first is the systematic repayment of a loan over time. The second is used in the context of business accounting and is the act of spreading the cost of an expensive and long-lived item over many periods."
## Rest TBD
Add features as assigned or desired.
